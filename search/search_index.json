Lecture and Communication Language English Theory/Laboratory Course Hour Per Week 3/2 Hours Credit 4 Prerequisite CE103- Algorithms and Programming I CE100- Algorithms and Programming II Corequisite TBD Requirement TBD *TBD: To Be Defined. A.Course Description \u00b6 This course introduces advanced programming skills with a focus on object-oriented programming and design fundamentals using a high-level language such as Java. Object-oriented programming is the process of integrating software components into a large-scale software architecture. After learning the fundamentals of coding, this approach to software development is the next logical step, allowing for large-scale programs. The course focuses on understanding and applying object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, data abstraction, methods, method overloading, inheritance, and polymorphism. The class will be built around sharing expertise and guiding students to find learning methods and practice for object-oriented programming topics. Making programming applications and projects in the courses will strengthen the learning process by putting theory into practice. B.Course Learning Outcomes \u00b6 After completing this course satisfactorily, a student will be able to: Design applications using OO techniques Use the unified software development process to manage software development Use UML for the notation diagrams of applications Apply useful design and architecture patterns for software development. C.Course Topics \u00b6 Object-oriented concepts Unified object-oriented analysis and design process Unified Model Language Use case analysis Object structure and behavior analysis System design Application architecture and design patterns Java implementation of object-oriented design D.Textbooks and Required Hardware or Equipment \u00b6 This course does not require a coursebook. If necessary, you can use the following books and open-source online resources. Timothy C. Lethbridge and Robert Lagani\u00e8re, Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Practical Software Development using UML and Java, McGraw Hill Walter Savitch, Absolute C++, Addison-Wesley Longman Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version (10 th Edition) 10 th Edition by Y.

Additional Books TBD During this course, you should have a laptop for programming practices. You will have your development environment, and you will use this for examination and assignments also classroom practices. E.Grading System \u00b6 Midterm and Final grades will be calculated with the weighted average of the project or homework-based examinations. Midterm grades will be calculated between term beginning to the midterm week, and Final grades will be calculated between Midterm and Final week homeworks or projects as follow \\[ a_n=\\text{Homework or Project Weight} \\] \\[ HW_n=\\text{Homework or Project Points} \\] \\[ n=\\text{Number of Homework or Project} \\] \\[ Grade=(a_1HW_1+a_2HW_2+...+a_nHW_n)/n \\] Homework Weight Midterm %40 Final %60 \\[ \\text{Passing Grade}=(40*Midterm_{Grade}+60*Final_{Grade})/100 \\] $$ $$ F. Instructional Strategies and Methods \u00b6 The basic teaching method of this course will be planned to be face-to-face in the classroom, and support resources, homeworks, and announcements will be shared over google classroom. Students are expected to be in the university. This responsibility is very important to complete this course with success. If pandemic situation changes and distance education is required during this course, this course will be done using synchronous and asynchronous distance education methods. In this scenario, students are expected to be in the online platform, zoom, or meet at the time specified in the course schedule. Attendance will be taken G. Late Homework \u00b6 Throughout the semester, assignments must be submitted as specified by the announced deadline. Overdue assignments will not be accepted. Unexpected situations must be reported to the instructor for late homeworks by students H. Course Platform and Communication \u00b6 Google Classroom and Github will be used as a course learning management system. All electronic resources and announcements about the course will be shared on this platform. It is very important to check the course page daily, access the necessary resources and announcements, and communicate with the instructor to complete the course with success. I. Academic Integrity, Plagiarism & Cheating \u00b6 Academic Integrity is one of the most important principles of RTE\u00dc University. Anyone who breaches the principles of academic honesty is severely punished. It is natural to interact with classmates and others t.\"study together\". It may also be the case where a student asks to help from someone else, paid or unpaid, better understand a difficult topic or a whole course. However, what is the borderline between \"studying together\" or \"taking private lessons\" and \"academic dishonesty\"? When is it plagiarism, when is it cheating? It is obvious that looking at another student's paper or any source other than what is allowed during the exam is cheating and will be punished. However, it is known that many students come to university with very little experience concerning what is acceptable and what counts as \"copying,\"\" especially for assignments. The following are attempted as guidelines for the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture students to highlight the philosophy of academic honesty for assignments for which the student will be graded. Should a situation arise which is not described below, the student is advised to ask the instructor or assistant of the course whether what they intend to do would remain within the framework of academic honesty or not. a. What is acceptable when preparing an assignment? \u00b6 Communicating with classmates about the assignment to understand it better Putting ideas, quotes, paragraphs, small pieces of code (snippets) that you find online or elsewhere into your assignment, provided that these are not themselves the whole solution to the assignment, you cite the origins of these Asking sources for help in guiding you for the English language content of your assignment. Sharing small pieces of your assignment in the classroom to create a class discussion on some controversial topics. Turning to the web or elsewhere for instructions, references, and solutions to technical difficulties, but not for direct answers to the assignment Discuss solutions to assignments with others using diagrams or summarized statements but not actual text or code. Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your assignment for you. b. What is not acceptable? \u00b6 Ask a classmate to see their solution to a problem before submitting your own. Failing to cite the origins of any text (or code for programming courses) that you discover outside of the course's lessons and integrate into your work You are giving or showing a classmate your solution to a problem when the classmate is struggling to solve it. J. Expectations \u00b6 You are expected to attend classes on time by completing weekly course requirements (readings and assignments) during the semester. The main communication channel between the instructor and the students email emailed. Please send your questions to the instructor's email address about the course via the email address provided to you by the university. Ensure that you include the course name in the subject field of your message and your name in the text field . In addition, the instructor will contact you via email if necessary. For this reason, it is very important to check your email address every day for healthy communication. K. Lecture Content and Syllabus Updates \u00b6 If deemed necessary, changes in the lecture content or course schedule can be made. If any changes are made in the scope of this document, the instructor will inform you about this.

At its most basic, digital information can assume only one of two possible values: one/zero , on/off , high/low , true/false , etc. Digital Information is less susceptible to noise than analog information Exact voltage values are not important, only their class (1 or 0) The complexity of operations is reduced, thus it is easier to implement them with high accuracy in digital form. Digital Systems \u00b6 Digital ; generates stores processes data \\(\\downarrow\\) two states : positive ( \\(1\\) ) and non-postitive ( \\(0\\) ) Digital Systems \u00b6 A \"digital system\" is a data technology that uses discrete (discontinuous) values represented by high and low states known as bits. non-digital (or analog) systems use a continuous range of values to represent information Binary Number System \u00b6 Binary ; describes a numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit: 0 and 1 Binary Number System a numbering system represents numeric values using 0 and 1 known as the base-2 number system BINARY NUMBER EXAMPLE \u00b6 10 111 10101 11110 COMPLIMENTS \u00b6 used in digital computers to simplify the subtraction operation and for logical manipulation There are 2 types of complements for each base r system (1) The radix complement (2) Diminished radix compliment Radix compliment : Also referred to as the r\u201ds compliment. Diminished radix compliment:Also referred to as (r-1)\u201ds compliment OCTAL NUMBERS \u00b6 a binary number is divided up into groups of only 3 bits set of bits having a distinct value of between 000 (0) and 111( 7 ) . Octal numbers therefore have a range of just \u201c8\u201d digits, (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) making them a Base-8 numbering system and therefore, q is equal to \u201c8\u201d HEXADECIMAL NUMBERING SYSTEM \u00b6 main disadvantage of binary numbers the binary string equivalent of a large decimal base-10 number can be quite long Working with large digital systems, such as computers, it is common to find binary numbers consisting of 8, 16 and even 32 digits Overcome the above problem: to arrange the binary numbers into groups or sets of four bits (4-bits) These groups of 4-bits uses another type of numbering system also commonly used in computer and digital systems called Hexadecimal Numbers uses the Base of 16 system Hexdecimal system format is quite compact and much easier to understand HEXADECIMAL NUMBERING SYSTEM \u00b6 Decimal Binary Octal Hexadecimal ---------------------------------------- 0 0000 0 0 1 0001 1 1 2 0010 2 2 3 0011 3 3 4 0100 4 4 5 0101 5 5 6 0110 6 6 7 0111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 SIGNED BINARY NUMBERS \u00b6 In mathematics , positive numbers ( including zero ) are represented as unsigned numbers we do not put the ( \\(+\\) ) ve sign in front of them to show that they are positive numbers When dealing with negative numbers we do use a ( \\(-\\) ) sign in front of the number to show that the number is negative in value and different from a positive unsigned value and the same is true with signed binary numbers However in digital circuits there is no provision made to put a plus or even a minus sign to a number digital systems operate with binary numbers that are represented in terms of \" \\(0\\) \"s\" and \" \\(1\\) \"s\" to represent a positive (N) and a negative (-N) binary number we can use the binary numbers with sign For signed binary numbers the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign If the sign bit is \" \\(0\\) \": the number is positive If the sign bit is \" \\(1\\) \": the number is negative The remaining bits are used to represent the magnitude of the binary number in the usual unsigned binary number format. Positive Signed Binary Number \u00b6 8-bit word \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} & | & \\overbrace{0}^{+sign} & | & 0 & | & 1 &| &\\overbrace{1}^{magnitude} & | & 0 & | & 1 & | & 0 & | & 1 & | & \\end{bmatrix} = 53 \\] Negative Signed Binary Number \u00b6 8-bit word \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} & | & \\overbrace{1}^{-sign} & | & 0 & | & 1 &| &\\overbrace{1}^{magnitude} & | & 0 & | & 1 & | & 0 & | & 1 & | & \\end{bmatrix} = -53 \\] BINARY CODES \u00b6 In the coding, when numbers, letters or words are represented by a specific group of symbols, it is said that the number, letter or word is being encoded The group of symbols is called as a code digital data is represented, stored and transmitted as group of binary bits called BINARYCODE Advantages of Binary Code \u00b6 Binary codes are suitable for the computer applications. Binary codes are suitable for the digital communications. Binary codes make the analysis and designing of digital circuits if we use the binary codes. Since only 0 & 1 are being used, implementation becomes easy. Classification of Binary Codes \u00b6 Weighted Codes Non-Weighted Codes Binary Coded Decimal Code Alphanumeric Codes Error Detecting Codes Error Correcting Codes Weighted Codes \u00b6 obey the positional weight principle Each position of the number represents a specific weight Several systems of the codes are used to express the decimal digits 0 through 9 \\[ \\begin{align*} & = 24 \\\\ & = \\overbrace{2}^{0010} \\overbrace{4}^{0100} \\\\ & \\downarrow \\\\ & \\overbrace{0}^{8}\\overbrace{0}^{4}\\overbrace{1}^{2}\\overbrace{0}^{1} = 2 \\\\ & \\overbrace{0}^{8}\\overbrace{1}^{4}\\overbrace{0}^{2}\\overbrace{0}^{1} = 4 \\end{align*} \\] Non-Weighted Codes \u00b6 In this type of binary codes, The positional weights are not assigned The examples of nonweighted codes are Excess-3 code and Gray code Excess-3 Code \u00b6 also called XS-3 code It is non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers The Excess-3 code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding (0011)2 or (3)10 to each code word in 8421 The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows Example : Decimal \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) \\(8421_{BCD}\\) \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) Excess-3 Decimal BCD Excess-3 8421 BCD+0011 ------------------------- 0 0000 0011 1 0001 0100 2 0010 0101 3 0011 0110 4 0100 0111 5 0101 1000 6 0110 1001 7 0111 1010 Gray Code \u00b6 It is the non-weighted code and it is not arithmetic codes Application of Gray code Gray code is popularly used in the shaft position encoders A shaft position encoder produces a code word which represents the angular position of the shaft Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Code \u00b6 In this code each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number BCD is a way to express each of the decimal digits with a binary code In the BCD, with four bits we can represent sixteen numbers (0000 to 1111) Decimal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ------------------------------------------------------------ BCD 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 Alphanumeric Codes \u00b6 Abinary digit or bit can represent only two symbols as it has only two states '0' or '1' But this is not enough for communication between two computers because there we need many more symbols for communication. These symbols are required to represent 26 alphabets with capital and small letters, numbers from 0 to 9, punctuation marks and other symbols The alphanumeric codes are the codes that represent numbers and alphabetic characters Mostly such codes also represent other characters such as symbol and various instructions necessary for conveying information The following three alphanumeric codes are very commonly used for the data representation.
